'''
Please reference the included PDF for complete instructions.

You can create your table (from the instructions) using a doc or spreadsheet.

Text comparisons are case sensitive. We will learn how to deal with this later.

Advanced students should attempt to implement
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock using 3 or 4 players instead (This is much harder.)
